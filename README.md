Summary of the Project:
The increase in demands for plastics and consequently an increase in global plastics production have considerably increased the quantity of spent plastics, out of which over 90% is either landfilled or incinerated. Both methods for handling spent plastics are susceptible to releasing toxic substances, greenhouse gases, that lead to detrimental effects on air, water, soil, organisms, and public health. Chemical additives may migrate out of the original plastic under certain conditions, contaminating its surroundings and causing unwanted hazards. Therefore, improvements to the existing infrastructure for plastics management are needed to limit chemical additive release and exposure resulting from the end-of-life (EoL) stage of plastics. This work aims to develop generic EoL management scenarios to track and estimate the potential migration and releases of plastic additives throughout the plastic EoL stage. A material flow analysis of the plastic life cycle was performed using available US municipal solid waste (MSW) data to track plastics and chemical additives movement from the manufacturing phase to the EoL stage, including mechanical recycling, waste-to-energy, and landfilling. Our analysis identified the mass flow intensity, greenhouse emissions, chemical additive migration, and subsequent releases from post-consumer plastics materials under the current and hypothetical scenarios involving enhanced recycling methods such as chemical routes. The potential hazards and risks identified in this research create an opportunity to design a safer closed-loop plastic recycling infrastructure to handle chemical additives strategically and support implementing sustainable materials management efforts to transform the US plastic economy from linear to circular.


This repository contains Excel spreadsheets used to calculate material flow throughout the plastics life cycle, with strong emphasis on chemical additives in the end-of-life stages. Three major scenarios were presented with the manuscript: 1) Current plastic waste management infrastructure, 2) implementing chemical recycling to the existing plastics recycling, and 3) extracting chemical additives prior to the manufacturing stage. 

General guideline for each spreadsheet: There are many tabs present in all three spreadsheets, which makes first time navigation relatively confusing.
